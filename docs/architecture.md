# Architecture

Lifeline uses a simple four-part architecture.

## 1. Manifest contract

The manifest contract is the source of truth for how a Lifeline-managed app should be described. It captures repo location, branch, commands, port, healthcheck, environment expectations, deployment strategy, and runtime restart/restore policy.

Manifest validation can stay structural in manifest-only mode. When a Playbook path is provided, Lifeline resolves a final config first and validates the resolved result instead.

## 2. Optional Playbook export surface

Playbook is one repo with two roles:

- a human-facing local UI/workflow for operators
- a machine-readable Lifeline export surface at `<playbook-path>/exports/lifeline/`

Lifeline only consumes Playbook export files from disk. There are no HTTP calls, no requirement that the Playbook UI be running, and no runtime dependency on an external service.

## 3. CLI operator

The CLI is the operator-facing entrypoint. Current commands:

- `validate`
- `resolve`
- `up`
- `down`
- `status`
- `logs`
- `restart`
- `restore`
- `startup` (merged Wave 2 backend seam with registered platform installers)

`up` resolves config and runs install/build, then launches a detached Lifeline supervisor process (not the app process directly).

## 4. Local runtime layer + startup contract surface (Wave 1 + merged Wave 2)

Runtime behavior:

- one supervisor process per app
- supervisor owns and monitors the child app process
- restart policy support: `runtime.restartPolicy` (`on-failure` or `never`)
- bounded restart backoff with crash-loop cutoff
- persisted runtime metadata in `.lifeline/state.json` (supervisor pid, child pid, restart counters, last exit)
- `restore` reads persisted state and re-launches restorable supervisors idempotently
- startup contract is configured via `startup`, with canonical restore wiring to `lifeline restore` and deterministic install/uninstall/inspect behavior through the startup backend seam
- cross-platform stop behavior: `taskkill /T /F` on Windows, process-group termination on POSIX

Logs remain file-based at `.lifeline/logs/<app>.log` and include both app output and supervisor lifecycle events.

## 5. Read-only privileged execution surface

Lifeline also exposes a narrow execution lane for capability-backed, approval-backed work:

- request, approval, and capability profile are loaded from local JSON files
- read-only filesystem inspection is allowed when the granted scope includes the target paths
- dry-run command execution is allowed when the approval and capability profile both allow the command
- blocked, rejected, and expired attempts still emit a receipt
- receipts are written locally and are part of the auditable trail
- worker-originated requests may carry `source_refs` to `_stack` assignment, status, merge, or handoff artifacts, and Lifeline preserves those refs in the receipt trail

This surface is intentionally not ambient admin. It is a receipt-backed executor for bounded read-only and dry-run actions only.

## Startup backend boundary

The merged Wave 2 contract provides startup intent/state plus registered machine-local installers behind one seam:

- `win32` → Task Scheduler (`windows-task-scheduler`)
- `linux` → user systemd (`systemd-user`)
- `darwin` → launchd LaunchAgent (`launchd-agent`)
- `freebsd` → rc.d (`freebsd-rc.d`)
- `openbsd` → rcctl (`openbsd-rcctl`)
- `netbsd` → rc.d (`netbsd-rc.d`)
- `aix` → inittab (`aix-inittab`)

All startup backends keep `lifeline restore` as the canonical restore entrypoint target and preserve `--dry-run` non-mutation semantics through the same seam. Unregistered platforms still resolve to the explicit `unsupported` contract-only fallback backend.
